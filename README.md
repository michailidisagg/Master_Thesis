The code used in my Master's Thesis


These files include python code used by Angelos Michailidis for his Master's thesis 'The study of radiation and magnetic field of plasma jets in the solar atmosphere' 
The files have the code for the magnetic field extrapolations, the processing of spectral data from SOLO/SPICE, and the creation of a First Ionization Potential (FIP) bias map, involving the low FIP element Mg and the high FIP element Ne.
